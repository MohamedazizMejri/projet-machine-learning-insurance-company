🔍 Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning 2 course . The goal is to build and evaluate a predictive model to determine whether a residential building will file an insurance claim during the policy period.

🏗️ Project Objective
To help an insurance company personalize its home insurance offers by integrating a machine learning model that predicts claim risk based on building attributes.
